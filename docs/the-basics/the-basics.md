The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a set of tools and processes that computers user to share files with each other. For most people, that's all you need to know about IPFS. But for developers and software engineers there's much more to discover under the hood.

This section walks through the problems the web is experiencing today, how IPFS fixes those problems, and the work that goes into IPFS and other projects.
