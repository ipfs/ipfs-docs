# IPFS implementations

IPFS is an open-source project that encourages the development of multiple implementations of the protocol, each of which seeks to optimize for various use cases. Below is non-exhaustive list of IPFS implementations, grouped by development and maintenance status ([Popular or Actively Maintained](#popular-or-actively-maintained), [Lite or Experimental](#lite-or-experimental) and [Inactive](#inactive)) and ordered alphabetically. To propose additions or edits, [edit this page in GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs/edit/main/docs/concepts/ipfs-implementations.md) or [open an issue](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=need%2Ftriage&template=open_an_issue.md&title=IPFS%20Implementations).

You can learn more about the principles that define what an IPFS implementation is [here](./implementations.md).

::: tip
Looking for an easy, user-friendly way to get started with IPFS? Try any of the options listed below:

- [IPFS Desktop](../install/ipfs-desktop.md), a single application that bundles an IPFS Kubo node, file manager, peer manager, and content explorer.
- [Brave Browser](../how-to/companion-node-types.md#native), native support for IPFS in a browser with a Kubo node built directly into the browser itself.
