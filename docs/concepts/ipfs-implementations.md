# IPFS implementations

IPFS is an open-source project that encourages the development of multiple implementations of the protocol, each of which seeks to optimize for various use cases. Below is non-exhaustive list of IPFS implementations, grouped by development and maintenance status ([Popular or Actively Maintained](#popular-or-actively-maintained), [Lite or Experimental](#lite-or-experimental) and [Inactive](#inactive)) and ordered alphabetically. To propose additions or edits, [edit this page in GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs/edit/main/docs/concepts/ipfs-implementations.md) or [open an issue](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=need%2Ftriage&template=open_an_issue.md&title=IPFS%20Implementations).

You can learn more about the principles that define what an IPFS implementation is [here](./implementations.md).


::: callout TLDR

Looking for an easy and opinionated way to get started with IPFS?

**User-Friendly Options**
  - [IPFS Desktop](../install/ipfs-desktop.md), an user-friendly GUI application that bundles an IPFS Kubo node for self-hosting, file manager, peer manager, and content explorer.
  - [IPFS Companion](../install/ipfs-companion.md), a browser extension that compliments IPFS Desktop, loads compatible websites and file paths from a local IPFS Kubo node.

**Command-Line & Infrastructure Tools**
  - [Kubo](../install/command-line.md), all-in-one demon service with command-line and HTTP RPC interface for power users who want to self-host, but don't need GUI.
  - [IPFS Cluster](../install/server-infrastructure.md), data orchestration across a swarm of IPFS Kubo daemons by allocating, replicating and tracking a global pinset distributed among multiple peers.
  - [Rainbow](https://github.com/ipfs/rainbow/#readme), production-grade standalone IPFS HTTP [Gateway](../concepts/glossary.md#gateway) service powering [public gateways](../concepts/public-utilities.md#public-ipfs-gateways).
