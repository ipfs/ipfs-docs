# IPFS implementations

The purpose of this page is to catalog the many IPFS <VueCustomTooltip label="Software, written in any programming language, with functionality to process and transmit content-addressed data. Some implementations are optimized for specific use cases or devices, or use different subsystems to handle content-addressed data. There are multiple specififactions in IPFS for handling content-addressed data, and not all implementations implement them." underlined multiline is-medium>implementations</VueCustomTooltip> and tools, as well as provide general guidance on choosing and implementation or tool to work with.

## Choose an implementation or tool

::: tip
Looking for an easy, user-friendly way to get started with IPFS? Try any of the options listed below:

- [IPFS Desktop](../install/ipfs-desktop.md), a single application that bundles an IPFS Kubo node, file manager, peer manager, and content explorer.
- [Brave Browser](../how-to/companion-node-types.md#native), native support for IPFS in a browser with a Kubo node built directly into the browser itself.
:::

The implementation or tool that you use to interact with and use IPFS depends on your particular use case. 

- [Use IPFS with your browser](#use-ipfs-with-your-browser)
- [Use IPFS without code](#use-ipfs-without-code)
- [Interact via the CLI](#interact-via-the-cli)
- [Develop applications](#develop-applications)

### Use IPFS with your browser

Interact with the network using any Brave, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, and any other Chromium-based web browser using the [IPFS Companion browser extension](../install/ipfs-companion.md).

### Use IPFS without code

- If you'd like desktop-native GUI application, IPFS Desktop bundles an IPFS node, file manager, peer manager, and content explorer together. No need to touch the terminal or use code. Just [install Desktop](../install/ipfs-desktop.md) and quickly access the network.
- To store data on IPFS persistently, without dealing with any applications or installations, you can also use a [pinning service](../concepts/persistence.md#pinning-services). You can follow [this quickstart guide](../quickstart/publish.md) to learn more.

### Interact via the CLI

You can interact with the IPFS network via the terminal:

- To quickly retrieve data with minimal complexity and overhead, use the [Lassie client](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lassie/), which provides a [simple command-line interface](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lassie/#command-line-interface), in addition to other features.
- For a wider range of features, use [IPFS Kubo as a command-line tool](../reference/kubo/cli.md).

### Develop applications

You can develop IPFS applications with native support in languages such as [Go](#go) or [JavaScript](#javascript), or by [using HTTP](#http). There are also tools available to support [specialized use cases such as data orchestration and mobile applications](#specialized-use-cases).

#### HTTP

If you'd like to use IPFS over standard HTTP, you have several options:

- If you simply want to retrieve data, use the [Lassie client HTTP API](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lassie/#http-api).
- You can control an IPFS Kubo node using HTTP via the [Kubo RPC API](../reference/kubo/rpc.md), with the same range of functionality available via the [Kubo CLI](kubo/cli.md). There are multiple [RPC API clients in multiple languages](../reference/kubo-rpc-cli.md) to choose from.
- For an implementation and runtime agnostic HTTP interface, use an [IPFS gateway](../reference/http/gateway.md).

#### Go

Looking for to add IPFS functionality to your Go application? Try these implementations:

- To quickly retrieve data with minimal complexity and overhead, use the [Lassie client Golang library](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lassie/#golang-library) in your applications.
- For more complicated applications requiring the full range of IPFS functionality, use Kubo or Boxo.

##### When to use Kubo

Use Kubo if you want:

- To run a full-featured IPFS node that can interact with the wider IPFS network.
- Build applications in Go.

##### When to use Boxo

Use Boxo if you:

- Are building a modular application that interacts with the IPFS network.
- Want more choice in which features you include in your application.
- Are building an IPFS implementation.
- Want to reuse some components of IPFS such as the Kademlia DHT, Bitswap, data encoding, etc.
- Want to experiment with IPFS.

#### JavaScript

To create IPFS applications in JavaScript, use the [IPFS Helia implementation in JavaScript](https://github.com/ipfs/helia).

#### Specialized use cases

##### Orchestrating nodes

For complex applications that require data orchestration across a swarm of IPFS daemons, use [ipfs-cluster](https://github.com/ipfs-cluster/ipfs-cluster), which allocates, replicates and tracks a global pinset distributed among multiple peers.

##### Embedded applications

- If you're looking to develop embedded applications in Java, use [Nabu](https://github.com/peergos/nabu).
- For embedded applications in Rust, use [ipfs-lite](https://github.com/hsanjuan/ipfs-lite).

##### Mobile applications

- For an iOS and Android app with IPFS read and share flows, try [Durin](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/Durin).
- If you need packages for Android, iOS and React-native that allow you to run and use an IPFS node on a mobile device, use [gomobile-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/gomobile-ipfs).
