# Concepts

Welcome to the Concepts section of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) docs. Here, you can:

- Learn what IPFS is and isn't, the problems it solves, the different subsystems that it is composed of and how each one works in [the 3-page Basic Concepts](#learn-the-basics).
- Dive into ideas like hashing, immutability, persistence (and more) that underlie IPFS in [Ideas and theory](#ideas-and-theory)
- Learn more about the subsystems that IPFS is composed of in [Subsystems and components](#subsystems-and-components)
- Get an [overview of IPFS implementations](../concepts/ipfs-implementations.md).
- [Compare IPFS to other similar systems](../concepts/comparisons.md).
- Get answers to common questions about IPFS in [the FAQ](../concepts/faq.md).
- Reference [the glossary of terms used in the IPFS ecosystem](../concepts/glossary.md).
- Read [academic papers written about IPFS, including the original IPFS whitepaper](../concepts/further-reading/academic-papers.md).
- Get inspired with [IPFS usage ideas and examples](#examples-and-case-studies).
- Learn about IPFS in theater mode with [these helpful videos](#video-overviews).

## Further reading

Want a more in-depth look into the decentralized web? Here are a few papers that are useful for understanding IPFS, whether it be understanding the IPFS spec itself or the background for the web, protocols, hashing, and so on. [Read the papers →](further-reading/academic-papers.md)
