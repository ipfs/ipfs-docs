# IPFS concepts

New to IPFS or the distributed web? Here's where to get started on understanding the key ingredients in what makes IPFS work. Because IPFS is a system that hopes to change how we use the Internet, it comes with many new concepts! This section aims to get you up to speed quickly.

## Video overviews

Want the basics in theater mode? Check out these helpful videos for an overview of how IPFS works with files and the overall data lifecycle in the d-web.

## Content-addressed storage

Referring to files by their content, not their location, is one of the most powerful concepts within IPFS. Learn why with explainers on:

- [Content addressing](content-addressing.md)
- [Cryptographic hashing](hashing.md)
- [Immutability](immutability.md)
- [Persistence, permanence and pinning](persistence.md)

## Peer-to-peer file sharing

Sharing files between peers is incredibly powerful — and has many nuances! Learn about file-sharing paradigms and tools:

- [Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs)](dht.md)
- [Merkle DAGs](merkle-dag.md)
- [Bitswap](bitswap.md)
- [IPLD](ipld.md)
- [IPNS](ipns.md)
- [libp2p](libp2p.md)
- [File systems](file-systems.md)

## Integrating IPFS and the existing Web

IPFS aims to be the future of the internet, but it still needs to play well with today's Web. Here are some ways to do just that:

- [IPFS Gateway](ipfs-gateway.md)
- [DNSLink](dnslink.md)

## Further reading

Want a more in-depth look into the decentralized web? Here are a few papers that are useful for understanding IPFS, whether it be understanding the IPFS spec itself or the background for the web, protocols, hashing, and so on. [Read the papers →](further-reading/academic-papers.md)
