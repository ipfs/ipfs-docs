## [Go-IPFS 0.8](/https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/releases/tag/v0.8.0)

This release is focused on making it easier to work with pins. We have some snazzy new features around being able to ask remote services to pin data for you, and modifying large pin sets is much faster than ever before.

## [Go-IPFS 0.7](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/releases/tag/v0.7.0)

With a focus on security and stability, this release removes support for SECIO, and enables `Ed25519` keys by default.

## [Go-IPFS 0.6](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/releases/tag/v0.6.0)

This is a relatively small release in terms of code changes, but it contains some significant changes to the IPFS protocol.

## [Go-IPFS 0.5](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/releases/tag/v0.5.0)

IPFS 0.5 features major performance upgrades to adding, providing, finding, and fetching data on IPFS.
