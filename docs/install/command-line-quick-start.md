# Command-line quick start

If you're command-line savvy and just want to get up and running with IPFS right away, follow this quick-start guide. Please note that this guide assumes that you'll be installing go-ipfs, the reference implementation written in Go.

::: tip
Don’t want to use the command line right now? Give the desktop-app implementation of IPFS a try. It also does all the steps listed on this page automatically, so you can run IPFS from the terminal later whenever you want. [Download IPFS Desktop now](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop)

## Install IPFS

Installing IPFS is simple, but varies between operating system:

| [Windows](#windows)                                                                      | [macOS](#macos)                                                                    | [Linux](#linux)                                                                    |

### Windows

1. Download the Windows binary from [`dist.ipfs.io`](https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs).

   ```powershell
   cd ~\
   wget https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/v0.5.1/go-ipfs_v0.5.1_windows-amd64.zip -Outfile go-ipfs_v0.5.1.zip
   ```

2. Unzip the file and move it somewhere handy.

   ```powershell
   Expand-Archive -Path go-ipfs_v0.5.1.zip -DestinationPath ~\Apps\go-ipfs_v0.5.1
   ```

3. Move into the `go-ipfs_v0.5.1` folder and check that the `ipfs.exe` works:

   ```powershell
   cd ~\Apps\go-ipfs_v0.5.1\go-ipfs
   .\ipfs.exe --version

   > ipfs version 0.5.1
   ```

   While you can use IPFS right now, it's better to add `ipfs.exe` to your `PATH.` by using the following steps.

4. Print the current working directory and copy it to your clipboard:

   ```powershell
   pwd

   > Path
   > ----
   > C:\Users\Johnny\Apps\go-ipfs_v0.5.1\go-ipfs
   ```

5. Add the address you just copied to PowerShell's `PATH` by adding it to the end of the `profile.ps1` file stored in `Documents\WindowsPowerShell`:

   ```powershell
   Add-Content C:\Users\Johnny\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\profile.ps1 "[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PATH',`$Env:PATH+';;C:\Users\Johnny\Apps\go-ipfs_v0.5.1\go-ipfs')"
   ```

6. Close and reopen your PowerShell window. Test that your IPFS path is set correctly by going to your home folder and asking IPFS for the version:

   ```powershell
   cd ~
   ipfs --version

   > ipfs version 0.5.1
   ```

### macOS

1. Download the macOS binary from [`dist.ipfs.io`](https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs).

   ```bash
   wget https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/v0.5.1/go-ipfs_v0.5.1_darwin-amd64.tar.gz
   ```

1. Unzip the file:

   ```bash
   tar -xvzf go-ipfs_v0.5.1_darwin-amd64.tar.gz

   > x go-ipfs/install.sh
   > x go-ipfs/ipfs
   > x go-ipfs/LICENSE
   > x go-ipfs/LICENSE-APACHE
   > x go-ipfs/LICENSE-MIT
   > x go-ipfs/README.md
   ```

1. Move into the `go-ipfs` folder and run the install script:

   ```bash
   bash install.sh

   > Moved ./ipfs to /usr/local/bin
   ```

1. Check that IPFS installed properly:

   ```bash
   ipfs --version

   > ipfs version 0.5.1
   ```

### Linux

1. Download the Linux binary from [`dist.ipfs.io`](https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs).

   ```bash
   wget https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/v0.5.1/go-ipfs_v0.5.1_linux-amd64.tar.gz
   ```

1. Unzip the file:

   ```bash
   tar -xvzf go-ipfs_v0.5.1_linux-amd64.tar.gz

   > x go-ipfs/install.sh
   > x go-ipfs/ipfs
   > x go-ipfs/LICENSE
   > x go-ipfs/LICENSE-APACHE
   > x go-ipfs/LICENSE-MIT
   > x go-ipfs/README.md
   ```

1. Move into the `go-ipfs` folder and run the install script:

   ```bash
   cd go-ipfs
   sudo bash install.sh

   > Moved ./ipfs to /usr/local/bin
   ```

1. Test that IPFS has installed correctly:

   ```bash
   ipfs --version

   > ipfs version 0.5.1
   ```

## Initialize the repository

`ipfs` stores all its settings and internal data in a directory called _the repository._ Before using IPFS for the first time, you’ll need to initialize the repository with the `ipfs init` command:

```bash
ipfs init
> initializing ipfs node at /Users/jbenet/.go-ipfs
> generating 2048-bit RSA keypair...done
> peer identity: Qmcpo2iLBikrdf1d6QU6vXuNb6P7hwrbNPW9kLAH8eG67z
> to get started, enter:
>
>   ipfs cat /ipfs/QmYwAPJzv5CZsnA625s3Xf2nemtYgPpHdWEz79ojWnPbdG/readme
```

If you are running on a server in a data center, you should initialize IPFS with the `server` profile. Doing so will prevent IPFS from creating a lot of data center-internal traffic trying to discover local nodes:

```bash
ipfs init --profile server
```

There are a whole host of other configuration options you may want to set — check [the full reference](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/config.md) for more.

The hash after `peer identity:` is your node’s ID and will be different from the one shown in the above output. Other nodes on the network use it to find and connect to you. You can run `ipfs id` at any time to get it again if you need it.

Now, try running the command suggested to you in the output of `ipfs init`. The one that looks like `ipfs cat /ipfs/<HASH>/readme`.

You should see something like this:

```text
Hello and Welcome to IPFS!

██╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗
██║██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝
██║██████╔╝█████╗  ███████╗
██║██╔═══╝ ██╔══╝  ╚════██║
██║██║     ██║     ███████║
╚═╝╚═╝     ╚═╝     ╚══════╝

If you see this, you have successfully installed
IPFS and are now interfacing with the ipfs merkledag!

```

You can explore other objects in the repository. In particular, the `quick-start` directory which shows example commands to try:

```bash
ipfs cat /ipfs/QmYwAPJzv5CZsnA625s3Xf2nemtYgPpHdWEz79ojWnPbdG/quick-start
```

## Take your node online

Once you're ready to join your node to the public network, run the ipfs daemon in another terminal and wait for all three lines below to appear to know that your node is ready:

```bash
ipfs daemon
> Initializing daemon...
> API server listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001
> Gateway server listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8080
```

Make a note of the TCP ports you receive. If they are different, use yours in the commands below.

Now, switch back to your original terminal. If you’re connected to the network, you should be able to see the ipfs addresses of your peers when you run:

```bash
ipfs swarm peers
> /ip4/104.131.131.82/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmaCpDMGvV2BGHeYERUEnRQAwe3N8SzbUtfsmvsqQLuvuJ
> /ip4/104.236.151.122/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmSoLju6m7xTh3DuokvT3886QRYqxAzb1kShaanJgW36yx
> /ip4/134.121.64.93/tcp/1035/ipfs/QmWHyrPWQnsz1wxHR219ooJDYTvxJPyZuDUPSDpdsAovN5
> /ip4/178.62.8.190/tcp/4002/ipfs/QmdXzZ25cyzSF99csCQmmPZ1NTbWTe8qtKFaZKpZQPdTFB
```

These are a combination of `<transport address>/ipfs/<hash-of-public-key>`.

Now, you should be able to get objects from the network. Try:

```bash
ipfs cat /ipfs/QmW2WQi7j6c7UgJTarActp7tDNikE4B2qXtFCfLPdsgaTQ/cat.jpg > cat.jpg
open cat.jpg
```

Next, try sending objects to the network, and then viewing it in your favorite browser. The example below uses `curl` as the browser, but you can open the IPFS URL in other browsers as well:

```bash
hash=`echo "I <3 IPFS -$(whoami)" | ipfs add -q`
curl "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/$hash"
> I <3 IPFS -<your username>
```

Cool, huh? The gateway served a file _from your computer_. The gateway queried the Distributed hash table (DHT), found your machine, requested the file, your computer sent it to the gateway, and the gateway sent it to your browser.

Depending on the state of the network, `curl` may take a while. The public gateways may be overloaded or having a hard time reaching you.

You can also check it out at your own local gateway:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/$hash"
> I <3 IPFS -<your username>
```

By default, your gateway is not exposed to the world. It only works locally.

## Web console

You can view the web console on your local node by going to [`localhost:5001/webui`](http://localhost:5001/webui). This should bring up a console like this:

## IPFS Companion

While we are at it, [IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion#ipfs-companion) is a browser extension that simplifies access to IPFS resources and adds support for the IPFS protocol.

It will automatically redirect IPFS gateway requests to your local daemon so that you are not relying on or trusting, remote gateways.

It runs in Firefox (desktop and Android) and various Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome or [Brave](https://brave.com).

## Troubleshooting

### Check your Go version

IPFS works with Go 1.12.0 or later. To check what go version you have installed, type `go version`:

```bash
go version

> go version go1.12.2 linux/amd64
```

If you need to update, we recommend you install from the [canonical Go packages](https://golang.org/doc/install). Package managers often contain out-of-date Go packages.

### Check that FUSE is installed

You need to install and set up FUSE in order to mount the file system. For more details on setting up FUSE, see [github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/fuse.md](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/fuse.md)
