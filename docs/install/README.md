# Get Started

IPFS is a collection of protocols, packages, and specifications that allow computers to send and receive data. Because of this, users can interact with and use IPFS in many different ways. A developer building network applications will use a different set of tools to interact with IPFS than someone who wants to store files on IPFS. Pick the one that best suits what you're here to do.

## Publish files with a pinning service

Do you want to quickly and easily publish content with IPFS without complex tools? See the [Publish with IPFS quickstart](../quickstart/publish.md), where you'll learn how to use pinning services to pin files to the IPFS network.

## IPFS Desktop

Anyone can use IPFS to store files in a _decentralized_ way. The easiest way to get up and running is by installing the IPFS Desktop application. This app has Kubo built-in and lets you interact with the network through a simple user-interface. [Check it out →](./ipfs-desktop.md)

## IPFS Kubo Node and CLI

Want to build decentralized applications and store your application data on IPFS? You'll likely want to install the command-line version of IPFS. There's no GUI to deal with, just raw input and output through your terminal. [Find out more →](./command-line.md)

## IPFS Helia for JS

[Helia](https://github.com/ipfs/helia) is a new implementation of IPFS in JavaScript that is designed to be more modular and lightweight than the [deprecated js-ipfs project](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs).

To get started with a hands-on example, see [Helia 101](https://github.com/ipfs-examples/helia-examples/blob/main/examples/helia-101/README.md) in [ipfs-examples/helia-examples](https://github.com/ipfs-examples/helia-examples/tree/main).

If you are looking for simple [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)-like API for use on the web, see [@helia/verified-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@helia/verified-fetch).

## IPFS Cluster

Planning to set up several Kubo nodes within one network? You'll want to take a look at installing [IPFS Cluster →](./server-infrastructure.md)

## IPFS Companion Browser Extension

Some browsers such as [Brave](https://brave.com/) and [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) come with IPFS built-in. If your browser doesn't support IPFS yet, you can install an IPFS companion extension that will let you view decentralized web content! [Learn more →](./ipfs-companion.md)
