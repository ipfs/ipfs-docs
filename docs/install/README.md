# Install IPFS

We're glad you're interested in giving IPFS a try! There are a lot of different ways to install and use IPFS — the best way to find the right one for you is to first consider what you want to accomplish or try out with IPFS. Take a look at the guide below to find the flavor of IPFS that's best for your needs.

_Just looking for instructions for installing straight from the command line? Follow our [quick-start guide](/how-to/command-line-quick-start)._

## Dip your toes in decentralized waters

Are you new to the decentralized web in general, or to IPFS in particular? Just want to get a feel for the technology before you dig any deeper? Try the IPFS Companion browser extension.

### Install IPFS Companion

IPFS Companion is a browser extension that enables you to request and use content delivered via IPFS just like any other content in your browser. [Learn more about IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion), or just try it out in your favorite browser:

- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ipfs-companion/) (desktop and Android)
- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipfs-companion/nibjojkomfdiaoajekhjakgkdhaomnch)

- [Edge](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipfs-companion/nibjojkomfdiaoajekhjakgkdhaomnch)

## Host and share files on your own

Want to go a step further than the IPFS browser extension? Try the IPFS desktop app.

### Install IPFS Desktop

IPFS Desktop enables you to host and share files directly from your computer with an easy-to-use interface — no programming required. And when you're ready to dig deeper, it also includes the same tool set you get if you'd installed directly from the commnand line. [Learn more about IPFS Desktop](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop), or just download it for your OS and give it a spin:

- [macOS](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/releases/download/v0.9.7/ipfs-desktop-0.9.7.dmg)
- [Windows](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/releases/download/v0.9.7/ipfs-desktop-setup-0.9.7.exe)

## Host and share files at scale

If you're interested in running IPFS for or with others, particularly at scale, IPFS Cluster is for you.

### Install IPFS Cluster

IPFS Cluster enables you to coordinate and orchestrate data across a "swarm" of multiple IPFS nodes, making it possible to distribute large data sets and "pin" data across peers to ensure redundancy and availability. It's useful for data sharing in academic and archival institutions or anyone engaged in a big-data endeavor. [Install IPFS Cluster now](https://cluster.ipfs.io/)
