# Get Started

IPFS is a collection of protocols, packages, and specifications that allow computers to send and receive data. Because of this, users can pick and choose which packages to install when using IPFS. And like shoe sizes, there is no _one-size-fits-all_ solution. A developer building network applications will install a different set of tools than someone who wants to store files on IPFS. Pick the one that best suits what you're here to do.

## IPFS Desktop

Anyone can use IPFS to store files in a _decentralized_ way. The easiest way to get up and running is by installing the IPFS Desktop application. This app has Kubo built-in and lets you interact with the network through a simple user-interface. [Check it out →](./ipfs-desktop.md)

For long-term storage, users can use the Filecoin network! Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network that stores files on the internet, with built-in economic incentives to ensure files are stored reliably over time. Available storage and pricing are not controlled by any single company. Instead, Filecoin facilitates open markets for storing and retrieving files that anyone can participate in. Learn more over on the [Filecoin docs website.](https://docs.filecoin.io/)

## IPFS Kubo

Want to build decentralized applications and store your application data on IPFS? You'll likely want to install the command-line version of IPFS. There's no GUI to deal with, just raw input and output through your terminal. [Find out more →](./command-line.md)

## IPFS Cluster

Planning to set up several IPFS nodes within one network? You'll want to take a look at installing [IPFS Cluster →](./server-infrastructure.md)

## IPFS Companion

Some browsers such as [Brave](https://brave.com/) and [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) come with IPFS built-in. If your browser doesn't support IPFS yet, you can install an IPFS companion extension that will let you view decentralized web content! [Learn more →](./ipfs-companion.md)
