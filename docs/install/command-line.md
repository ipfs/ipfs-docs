# Command-line

Installing IPFS through the command-line is handy if you plan on building applications and services on top of an IPFS node. This method is also useful if you're setting up a node without a user interface, usually the case with remote servers or virtual machines. Using IPFS through the command-line allows you to do everything that IPFS Desktop can do, but at a more granular level since you can specify which commands to run.

## System requirements

IPFS requires 512MiB of memory and can run an IPFS node on a Raspberry Pi. However, how much disk space your IPFS installation takes up depends on how much data you're sharing. A base installation takes up about 12MB of disk space. One can enable automatic garbage collection via [--enable-gc](/reference/cli/#ipfs-daemon) and adjust the [default maximum disk storage](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/v0.10.0/docs/config.md#datastorestoragemax) for data retrieved from other peers.

## Official distributions

The IPFS team manages the [dist.ipfs.io website](https://dist.ipfs.io/) to help users quickly find the latest version of every IPFS package. As soon as a new release of an IPFS package comes out, it is automatically shown on `dist.ipfs.io`, so you can be sure you're getting the latest software. These steps detail how to download and install the latest `go-ipfs` from `dist.ipfs.io` using the command-line.

### Windows

1. Download the Windows binary from [`dist.ipfs.io`](https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs).

   ```powershell
   cd ~\
   wget https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/v0.10.0/go-ipfs_v0.10.0_windows-amd64.zip -Outfile go-ipfs_v0.10.0.zip
   ```

2. Unzip the file and move it somewhere handy.

   ```powershell
   Expand-Archive -Path go-ipfs_v0.10.0.zip -DestinationPath ~\Apps\go-ipfs_v0.10.0
   ```

3. Move into the `go-ipfs_v0.10.0` folder and check that the `ipfs.exe` works:

   ```powershell
   cd ~\Apps\go-ipfs_v0.10.0\go-ipfs
   .\ipfs.exe --version

   > ipfs version 0.10.0
   ```

   While you can use IPFS right now, it's better to add `ipfs.exe` to your `PATH` by using the following steps.

4. Print the current working directory and copy it to your clipboard:

   ```powershell
   pwd

   > Path
   > ----
   > C:\Users\Johnny\Apps\go-ipfs_v0.10.0\go-ipfs
   ```

5. Add the address you just copied to PowerShell's `PATH` by adding it to the end of the `profile.ps1` file stored in `Documents\WindowsPowerShell`:

   ```powershell
   Add-Content C:\Users\Johnny\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\profile.ps1 "[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PATH',`$Env:PATH+';;C:\Users\Johnny\Apps\go-ipfs_v0.10.0\go-ipfs')"
   ```

6. Close and reopen your PowerShell window. Test that your IPFS path is set correctly by going to your home folder and asking IPFS for the version:

   ```powershell
   cd ~
   ipfs --version

   > ipfs version 0.10.0
   ```

### macOS

:::tip M1-based Macs
You can install IPFS on M1-based Macs by using the `darwin-arm64` binary instead of the `amd64` binary listed in these instructions.
:::

1. Download the macOS binary from [`dist.ipfs.io`](https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs).

   ```bash
   wget https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/v0.10.0/go-ipfs_v0.10.0_darwin-amd64.tar.gz
   ```

1. Unzip the file:

   ```bash
   tar -xvzf go-ipfs_v0.10.0_darwin-amd64.tar.gz

   > x go-ipfs/install.sh
   > x go-ipfs/ipfs
   > x go-ipfs/LICENSE
   > x go-ipfs/LICENSE-APACHE
   > x go-ipfs/LICENSE-MIT
   > x go-ipfs/README.md
   ```

1. Move into the `go-ipfs` folder and run the install script:

   ```bash
   cd go-ipfs
   bash install.sh

   > Moved ./ipfs to /usr/local/bin
   ```

1. Check that IPFS installed:

   ```bash
   ipfs --version

   > ipfs version 0.10.0
   ```

### Linux

1. Download the Linux binary from [`dist.ipfs.io`](https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs).

   ```bash
   wget https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/v0.10.0/go-ipfs_v0.10.0_linux-amd64.tar.gz
   ```

1. Unzip the file:

   ```bash
   tar -xvzf go-ipfs_v0.10.0_linux-amd64.tar.gz

   > x go-ipfs/install.sh
   > x go-ipfs/ipfs
   > x go-ipfs/LICENSE
   > x go-ipfs/LICENSE-APACHE
   > x go-ipfs/LICENSE-MIT
   > x go-ipfs/README.md
   ```

1. Move into the `go-ipfs` folder and run the install script:

   ```bash
   cd go-ipfs
   sudo bash install.sh

   > Moved ./ipfs to /usr/local/bin
   ```

1. Test that IPFS has installed correctly:

   ```bash
   ipfs --version

   > ipfs version 0.10.0
   ```

## Compile manually

Manually compiling IPFS is a fairly involved process that changes frequently. It can be handy if you'd like to build a specific branch or use the _bleeding-edge_ version of Go-IPFS. See the [`ipfs/go-ipfs` GitHub repository for details â†’](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs)

## Next steps

Now that you've got an IPFS node installed, you can start building applications and services on top of the network! Check out the Command-line- quicks start guide and jump straight to the [Initialize the repository section](../how-to/command-line-quick-start.md#initialize-the-repository).
