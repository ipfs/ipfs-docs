::: callout
**Welcome, builders!** No matter who you are or what you're creating, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) makes it easier for you to build the decentralized apps and services that will power the next generation of the internet.

## What is IPFS?

**IPFS is a content-addressed system for storing and delivering data over a globally distributed network of peers.** As a critical ingredient in a wide variety of decentralized applications and services powering the future of the internet, IPFS is an important complement to blockchains, decentralized identity, verifiable storage like [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io), and other ingredients in a distributed web (dWeb) stack.

## Who's building on IPFS

**Individuals and organizations worldwide are using IPFS to build successful apps and services for a truly amazing variety of use cases and industries.** Whether you're interested in NFTs or networked communities, streaming music or social media, IPFS can play a critical part in your decentralized tech stack. Check out these resources:

- [**Case Study Series**](concepts/README.md#examples-and-case-studies) — Success stories in industries ranging from big data to e-commerce and more.
- [**IPFS Ecosystem Explorer**](https://ecosystem.ipfs.tech) — Traverse the full landscape of companies shipping apps, services, and more built on IPFS.
- [**Awesome IPFS**](https://awesome.ipfs.tech) — Community projects of all shapes and sizes, from production apps to open-source data sets to experimental repos.

Or, check out the [Building Web3 video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_0VrY55uV1-THfh1GVoE6v0SxKO9M0gs) to meet the visionaries who are building the future using IPFS and other web3 tools!

## IPFS and you

**What can _you_ build using IPFS?** Thanks to a rapidly growing developer community, global traction for a wide variety of use cases, and active open-source development, the possibilities are virtually endless. Check out these [usage ideas and examples](concepts/usage-ideas-examples.md) for inspiration, plus these pointers for getting started integrating IPFS into your project:

- With implementations in [Go](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo) and [JavaScript](https://js.ipfs.tech/) (plus [Rust](https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ipfs) in the works), options for **directly integrating IPFS into your codebase** are versatile.
- For **IPFS-based deployment and dev tools**, the options are growing every day — including [Spheron](https://spheron.network) (deployment, storage, app tooling, gateways and compute deployments), [Fleek](https://fleek.co) (deployment, storage, and app tooling), [Textile](https://textile.io) (databases, storage, CDN, Filecoin integration), and [Fission](https://fission.codes) (front-end app publishing using web3 back-end tools), to name just a few.
- Want to integrate **Filecoin** into your architecture in addition to IPFS? [Learn how Filecoin and IPFS work together](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/how-storage-works/filecoin-and-ipfs/).
- For hosting large amounts of data on multiple nodes, [IPFS Cluster](https://ipfscluster.io/) helps you with **data orchestration across many peers**.
- Or, to **ensure availability** without having to maintain your own IPFS infrastructure, you can use a [third-party pinning service](concepts/persistence.md#pinning-services) to host your files on their own nodes.
