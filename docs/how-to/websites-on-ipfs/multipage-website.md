# Multi-page website

In this guide you will learn how to host a website with multiple pages and external assets on IPFS. This tutorial is the second in a series of tutorials aimed at teaching web developers how to build websites and applications using IPFS. You don't need to have completed the previous tutorial to understand what's going on here, but if you're new to the IPFS ecosystem it's a good idea to follow through the [single page website guide](/how-to/websites-on-ipfs/single-page-website) before you start this one. It will give you a solid foundation to work off.

## Prerequisites

If you followed the previous tutorial, you will already have the IPFS Desktop application installed. If not, you can grab it from the [IPFS Shipyard](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop).

## Project set up

Before we dig into IPFS, let's first create the files we'll need for this mini-project.

1. Create a folder called `multi-page-first-step`.
1. Within this new folder, create a file called `index.html` and paste in the following code. We'll continue using the [Random Planet Facts](https://randomplanetfacts.xyz) website from the previous tutorial, with an added link to an _About_ page:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8" />
       <title>Random Planet Facts</title>
       <meta
         name="description"
         content="Get a random fact about a planet in our solar system."
       />
       <meta name="author" content="The IPFS Docs team." />
       <style>
         body {
           margin: 15px auto;
           max-width: 650px;
           line-height: 1.2;
           font-family: sans-serif;
           font-size: 2em;
           color: #fff;
           background: #444;
         }
         a {
           color: yellowgreen;
         }
       </style>
     </head>
     <body onload="main()">
       <h1>Random Planet Facts</h1>
       <img src="moon-logo.png" />
       <p id="output_p"></p>
       <h2><a href="about.html">About this website</a></h2>
       <script>
         function main() {
           const facts = [
             'Mars is home to the tallest mountain in our solar system.',
             'Only 18 out of 40 missions to Mars have been successful.',

             'Venus is nearly as big as the Earth with a diameter of 12,104 km.',
             'The Earth’s rotation is gradually slowing.',
             'There is only one natural satellite of the planet Earth, the moon.',
             'Earth is the only planet in our solar system not named after a god.',
             'The Earth is the densest planet in the solar system.',
             'A year on Jupiter lasts around 4333 earth days.',
             'The surface temperature of Jupiter is around -108°C.',
             'Jupiter was first discovered by 7th or 8th century Babylonian astronomers.',

             'Saturn can be seen with the naked eye.',
             'Saturn is the flattest planet.',
             'Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen.',
             'Four spacecraft have visited Saturn.',
             'Uranus was discovered by William Herschel in 1781.',
             'A year on Uranus takes 30687 earth days.',

             'Venus spins backwards.',
             'Uranus spins sideways, relative to the ecliptic plane of the solar system.',
             'It is easier to reach Pluto or escape the solar system from Earth than being able to <i>land</i> on the Sun.'
           ]
           document.querySelector('#output_p').innerHTML =
             facts[Math.floor(Math.random() * facts.length)]
         }
       </script>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

1. Create another file, this time called `about.html` and paste in the following code:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8" />
       <title>About | Random Planet Facts</title>
       <meta
         name="description"
         content="Get a random fact about a planet in our solar system."
       />
       <meta name="author" content="The IPFS Docs team." />
       <style>
         body {
           margin: 15px auto;
           max-width: 650px;
           line-height: 1.2;
           font-family: sans-serif;
           font-size: 2em;
           color: #fff;
           background: #444;
         }
         a {
           color: yellowgreen;
         }
       </style>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Random Planet Facts</h1>
       <p>
         This website gives you random facts about the <i>planets</i> our solar
         system! Refresh the homepage to see a new fact!
       </p>
       <h2><a href="index.html">Go back home</a></h2>
       <footer>
         <hr />
         Created with ❤️ by the IPFS team.
       </footer>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

1. Finally, download [this image](./images/multipage-website/moon-logo.png) and save it in the folder as `moon-logo.png`:

   ![Icon of the moon with stars and circles in the background.](./images/multipage-website/moon-logo.png)

You should now have a folder that looks something like this:

    ```
    multi-page-first-step/
    ├── about.html
    ├── index.html
    └── moon-logo.png
    ```

## Add files to IPFS

Now that you've got the project ready, we can add things to IPFS using the IPFS Desktop application. Instead of adding the files individually, we can add the whole project folder, and the IPFS Desktop app will take care of the rest for us!

1. Open the IPFS Desktop application and select **Add** > **Folder**.
1. Select the `multi-page-website` folder. Once it's loaded you should be able to see the folder within the application:

   ![The IPFS Desktop application with the multi-page project folder showing.](./images/multipage-website/ipfs-desktop-with-multi-page-folder-showing.png)

1. Click the tripple dot menu to the right and select **Share link**.
1. Click **Copy** and paste the link in a browser. You should be able to see your website with the logo!

   ![Random space facts open in a Firefox browser window.](./images/multipage-website/website-open-in-firefox.png)

   Try clicking the link to the about page. You should be able to browser between the pages no problem.

<!-- TODO: explain what's happening in the background, and why the links have to be relative in order to work. -->

## Up next

In the next tutorial we'll look at [linking a domain name to your site!](/how-to/websites-on-ipfs/link-a-domain)
