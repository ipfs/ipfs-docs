# Static-site generators

Static-site generators like Hugo, Jekyll, Middleman, Next.js, and VuePress are all incredibly popular platforms building websites quickly. This guide walks through how to integrate IPFS into each of these workflows.

## Hugo

Refer to Hugo's [Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) to install and set up your project.

In `config.toml` add `relativeURLs` and set it to `true`.

```
relativeURLs=true
```

Build static pages

```bash
hugo -D
```

Output will be in `./public/` directory by default. Upload the public folder to IPFS.

## VuePress

Refer to VuePress' [Getting Started](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/) to install and set up your project.

To build a static site:

```bash
vuepress build
```

Output will be in `./.vuepress/dist` directory by default.

Use a command to convert a static site to only use relative URLs. In this example, we'll be using [all-relative](https://www.npmjs.com/package/all-relative)

```bash
cd .vuepress/dist/
npx all-relative
```

Upload the `dist` folder to IPFS.

## Middleman

Refer the Middleman's [Installation](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/install/) guide to install Ruby and Middleman.

1. Enable relative links and disable index file strip in your project's `config.rb` file:

    ```ruby
    set :relative_links, true
    set :strip_index_file, false
    ```

    Links generated by the `link_to` helper or by markdown will become relative.

1. Build your static site:

    ```bash
    middleman build
    ```

    Middleman will output your site to the `./build` folder.

1. Upload the `build` folder to IPFS.

## Jekyll

Refer to Jekyll's [Installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) guide to install Ruby and Jekyll.

Refer to Jekyll's [Quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) to set up your project.

To build a static site:

```bash
jekyll build
```

Output will be in `./_site` by default.

Use a command to convert a static site to only use relative URLs. In this example, we'll be using [all-relative](https://www.npmjs.com/package/all-relative)

```bash
cd _site/
npx all-relative
```

Upload the `_site` folder to IPFS.

## WordPress

While WordPress is not a static site generator, it is possible to turn it into a static website and migrate it over to a static-hosting service. [Take a look at this blog post from Fleek that walks you through the whole process](https://blog.fleek.co/posts/wordpress+fleek)!

Keep in mind that you will lose the ability to manage your website's content through the WordPress _back-end_, and that this process requires that you install a plugin along-side your WordPress site.
