title: Configure a node
description: IPFS nodes can be customized using the configuration file. The default values should be fine for most use-cases. However, you may want to make some changes if you are running a specialized IPFS node, or simply want to tweak things to your liking.

# Configure a node

Node configuration varies between implementations.

- For Kubo, see [config.md](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md). 
- For Helia, see the [HeliaInit](https://ipfs.github.io/helia/interfaces/helia.HeliaInit.html) document. Note that, unlike the deprecated js-ipfs implementation, you must configure your node directly - see the [Helia example](https://github.com/ipfs/helia/wiki/Migrating-from-js-IPFS#config).
