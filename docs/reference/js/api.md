## Working with IPFS in JS

There are two main JavaScript libraries for working with IPFS. Both work in Node.js and in modern web browsers:

- **[`js-ipfs`](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/packages/ipfs)** is a full implementation of IPFS, similar to [`go-ipfs`](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs). You can use it either as a command-line application or as a library to start an IPFS node directly in your program.

- **[`js-ipfs-http-client`](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/packages/ipfs-http-client)** is a smaller library that controls an IPFS node that is already running via its [HTTP API](/reference/http/api/). `js-ipfs` actually uses this library internally if it detects that another node is already running on your computer. You can also interact with the [HTTP API](/reference/http/api/) directly using `fetch()` in a browser or a module like `request` in Node.js, but using this library can be much more convenient.

Both libraries have the same [interface for using all the major IPFS commands](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/docs/core-api).

Whenever reasonable, we recommend the second method (interacting with a separate IPFS node via the HTTP API). Keeping the IPFS node in a separate process (even if it’s one your program spawns) isolates you from any stability problems with the node. If a user already has IPFS installed, this also means you can take advantage of a single, common installation on their computer. It’s also less code to load in a browser. If you need to spawn a separate IPFS process, you might want to take a look at [`js-ipfsd-ctl`](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfsd-ctl), which uses the same interface to spawn a `go-ipfs` node, a `js-ipfs` node, or an in-process `js-ipfs` node.

### IPFS in browsers

Both the `js-ipfs` and `js-ipfs-http-client` libraries work in browsers, but each has some special considerations noted in their READMEs.

You may also be interested in the IPFS browser extension, [IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion). If a visitor to your site has it installed, it will make a global [`window.ipfs`](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/blob/master/docs/window.ipfs.md) object available to your JavaScript. This object has the same interface as `js-ipfs-api`, but comes with much better security controls and lets you use IPFS without loading any special libraries.

## JS core API reference

See the [JS core API reference](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/docs/core-api) here.

## JS HTTP client library

A [client library](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/packages/ipfs-http-client) for the IPFS HTTP API, implemented in JavaScript. This client library implements the interface-ipfs-core enabling applications to change between an embedded js-ipfs node and any remote IPFS node without having to change the code. In addition, this client library implements a set of utility functions.
