# IPFS in JavaScript

Developers can get started with IPFS in JavaScript using Helia, a lean, modular, and modern implementation of IPFS for the JS and browser environments. Helia superseded [js-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs), which was the first JS implementation. Learn more at [https://github.com/ipfs/helia](https://github.com/ipfs/helia).

## Hands-on examples

New to IPFS or JavaScript? Get started with the [Helia 101 example](https://github.com/ipfs-examples/helia-examples/tree/main/examples/helia-101), which will walk you through spawning a Helia node, adding a file, and `cat`-ing the file CID both locally and through an IPFS gateway.

Additional Helia examples can be found [here](https://github.com/ipfs-examples/helia-examples/tree/main).
