# IPFS in JavaScript

Developers can get started with IPFS in JavaScript (JS)  using several options:

- [IPFS Helia](https://helia.io): a lean, modular, and modern implementation of IPFS for the JS and browser environment
- [js-kubo-rpc-client](https://github.com/ipfs/js-kubo-rpc-client): A JS client library for the [Kubo RPC API](../kubo/rpc.md)

## Get started

### Helia

New to IPFS Helia? The [Helia 101 example](https://github.com/ipfs-examples/helia-examples/tree/main/examples/helia-101) will walk you through spawning a Helia node, adding a file, and `cat`-ing the file CID both locally and through an IPFS gateway. More advanced Helia examples can be found [here](https://github.com/ipfs-examples/helia-examples/tree/main).

### js-kubo-rpc-client

First, [install the client using `npm` or as a browser script tag](https://github.com/ipfs/js-kubo-rpc-client#install). Then, consult the [command reference](https://github.com/ipfs/js-kubo-rpc-client#usage) for usage information.
