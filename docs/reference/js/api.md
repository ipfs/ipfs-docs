# IPFS in JavaScript

## Helia

Developers can get started with IPFS in JavaScript using Helia, a lean, modular, and modern implementation of IPFS for the JS and browser environments. Learn more at [https://helia.io](https://helia.io).

### Hands-on examples

New to IPFS or JavaScript? Get started with the [Helia 101 example](https://github.com/ipfs-examples/helia-examples/tree/main/examples/helia-101), which will walk you through spawning a Helia node, adding a file, and `cat`-ing the file CID both locally and through an IPFS gateway.

Additional Helia examples can be found [here](https://github.com/ipfs-examples/helia-examples/tree/main).

## JS-IPFS (no-longer maintained)

[JS-IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) was the first IPFS implementation in JavaScript. It still exists in its current form, but is no longer actively maintained. Please read [this post](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/4336) to understand why this was done. For newer projects we recommend using [Helia](#helia) instead.
