# API & CLI reference

Looking for user and developer references for IPFS? Find them here.

## HTTP Gateway

The [Gateway API](http/gateway.md) provides implementation-agnostic HTTP interface for retrieving [content-addressed](../concepts/glossary.md#content-addressing) data from IPFS with regular HTTP clients and libraries. Use it for future-proofing your applications.

## Custom APIs

Implementation and language specific interfaces can be used when [HTTP Gateway API](http/gateway.md) is not enough, or you need additional flexibility.

### Kubo (go-ipfs)

Kubo is the earliest and most widely used implementation of IPFS, written in Go.

Use it as:

- **CLI tool**
  Working in the terminal? Here's where you'll find [Kubo's command-line interface (CLI) reference](kubo/cli.md).

- **HTTP RPC endpoint**
  [RPC API v0 reference for Kubo](kubo/rpc.md) â€” control your node over HTTP using the same commands you can from the command line!

- **Go library**
  See [Go API reference for Kubo](go/api.md), including the Go CoreAPI, the Go embedded client, and a Go client for interacting with Kubo over HTTP RPC API.


### JavaScript (js-ipfs)

[API resources for js-ipfs](js/api.md), including the JS core API reference and the JS HTTP client library.
