IPFS can run in either _online_ or _offline_ mode. Online mode is when you have IPFS running separately as a daemon process. If you do not have an IPFS daemon running, you are in offline mode. Some commands, like \`ipfs swarm peers\`, are only supported when online.

The [command-line quickstart guide](../..//how-to/command-line-quick-start.md) explains how to start the IPFS daemon and take your node online.

### Alignment with Kubo RPC API

Every command usable from the CLI is also available through the [RPC API v0](../../reference/kubo/rpc.md). For example:

\`\`\`sh
> ipfs swarm peers
/ip4/104.131.131.82/tcp/4001/p2p/QmaCpDMGvV2BGHeYERUEnRQAwe3N8SzbUtfsmvsqQLuvuJ

/ip4/104.236.176.52/tcp/4001/p2p/QmSoLnSGccFuZQJzRadHn95W2CrSFmZuTdDWP8HXaHca9z
