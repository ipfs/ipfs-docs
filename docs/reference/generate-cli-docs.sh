IPFS can run in either _online_ or _offline_ mode. Online mode is when you have IPFS running separately as a daemon process. If you do not have an IPFS daemon running, you are in offline mode. Some commands, like \`ipfs swarm peers\`, are only supported when online. The [command-line quickstart guide](../how-to/command-line-quick-start/#take-your-node-online) explains how to start the IPFS daemon and take your node online.

### Alignment with HTTP API

Every command usable from the CLI is also available through the [HTTP API](/reference/http/api). For example:

\`\`\`sh
> ipfs swarm peers
