# Welcome to the IPFS docs

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a set of composable, peer-to-peer protocols for addressing, routing, and transferring [content-addressed](concepts/glossary.md#content-addressing) data in a decentralized file system. Many popular Web3 projects are built on IPFS - see the [ecosystem directory](https://ecosystem.ipfs.tech) for a list of some of these projects.

## Get started

You can quickly [store and retrieve data](#store-and-retrieve-data) and [interact with the network via a simple GUI app or a standard browser](#interact-with-the-network). If you'd rather develop applications, learn how to build IPFS-native apps or use standard HTTP in the [Build](#build) section.

### Store and retrieve data

Quickly store data and retrieve data, no complex applications or programming required:

- Publish content to the IPFS network with a pinning service by following this [quickstart guide](./quickstart/publish.md).
- Fetch data via it's <VueCustomTooltip label="An address used to point to data in IPFS, based on the content itself, as opposed to the location." underlined multiline is-medium>content identifier (CID)</VueCustomTooltip> [using an IPFS gateway](./quickstart/retrieve.md#fetching-the-cid-with-an-ipfs-gateway).
- For long-term storage, use [Filecoin](https://docs.filecoin.io/), the peer-to-peer network with built-in economic incentives that stores data on IPFS.

### Interact with the network 

You can quickly interact the IPFS network using a simple GUI or a standard browser:

- For a simple, easy-to-use GUI application that bundles an IPFS node, file manager, peer manager, and content explorer, use [IPFS Desktop](./install/ipfs-desktop.md).
- Interact with the network using any Brave, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, and any other Chromium-based web browser using the [IPFS Companion browser extension](./install/ipfs-companion.md).

### Build

You can build apps that leverage IPFS implementations, or use HTTP instead:

#### Using IPFS

Build an IPFS-native app using one of the many IPFS <VueCustomTooltip label="Software, written in any programming language, with functionality to process and transmit content-addressed data. Some implementations are optimized for specific use cases or devices, or use different subsystems to handle content-addressed data. There are multiple specififactions in IPFS for handling content-addressed data, and not all implementations implement them." underlined multiline is-medium>implementations</VueCustomTooltip> and tools built by and for Web3 users:

- To develop IPFS applications using Go and/or interact with IPFS from the terminal, use the [IPFS Kubo implementation in Go](./install/command-line.md). 
- If you'd rather use JavaScript, try the [IPFS Helia implementation in JavaScript](https://github.com/ipfs/helia).
- Try any of the [many other tools and implementations](./concepts/ipfs-implementations.md), which are written in different languages and tailored to specific needs and use cases.

#### Using HTTP

Connect your Web2 application to the IPFS network using standard HTTP:

- Control an IPFS Kubo node via HTTP using the [Kubo RPC API](./reference/kubo/rpc.md), which supports [multiple clients in multiple languages](./reference/kubo-rpc-cli.md).
- For an implementation and runtime agnostic HTTP interface for retrieving data, use an [IPFS gateway](./reference/http/gateway.md).

## Learn

- Learn what IPFS is and isn't, the problems it solves, the different subsystems that it is composed of and how each one works in [the Basic Concepts](./concepts/README.md#learn-the-basics).
- Dive into ideas like hashing, immutability, persistence (and more) that underlie IPFS in [Ideas and theory](./concepts/README.md#ideas-and-theory).
- Learn more about the subsystems that IPFS is composed of in [Subsystems and components](./concepts/README.md#subsystems-and-components)
- Get an [overview of IPFS implementations](./concepts/ipfs-implementations.md).
- [Compare IPFS to other similar systems](./concepts/comparisons.md).
- Understand the project history, ecosystem status and more in the [Project section](./project/README.md).
- See how other software systems leverage IPFS in the [Case Studies section](./case-studies/arbol.md).
