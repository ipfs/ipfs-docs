# Welcome to the IPFS docs

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a set of composable, peer-to-peer protocols for addressing, routing, and transferring [content-addressed](concepts/glossary.md#content-addressing) data in a decentralized file system. Many popular Web3 projects are built on IPFS - see the [ecosystem directory](https://ecosystem.ipfs.tech) for a list of some of these projects.

## Learn

:::tip
New to IPFS? Start with
[the 3-page Basic Concepts](./concepts/README.md#learn-the-basics).
:::

- Learn what IPFS is and isn't, the problems it solves, the different subsystems that it is comprised of and how each one works in [the Basic Concepts](./concepts/README.md#learn-the-basics).
- Dive into ideas like hashing, immutability, persistence (and more) that underlie IPFS in [Ideas and theory](./concepts/README.md#ideas-and-theory).
- Learn more about the subsystems that IPFS is comprised of in [Subsystems and components](./concepts/README.md#subsystems-and-components)
- Get an [overview of IPFS implementations](./concepts/ipfs-implementations.md).
- [Compare IPFS to other similar systems](./concepts/comparisons.md).
- Understand the project history, ecosystem status and more in the [Project section](./project/README.md).
- See how other software systems leverage IPFS in the [Case Studies section](./case-studies/arbol.md).

## Develop

:::tip
Are you developing with IPFS implementations and tools, and looking for technical support from IPFS experts? For the fastest possible assistance and resolution of your support needs, see the [guide to getting technical help and support](./community/README.md#get-technical-support-and-help).
:::

- Install and set up various IPFS implementations and tools in [Get Started](./install/README.md).
- Get inspired with [IPFS usage ideas and examples](#examples-and-case-studies).
- Find reference material for IPFS implementations, tools and the HTTP API in the [API and CLI references](./reference/README.md).
- Learn by doing with the hands-on guides available in the [How-to guides](./how-to/README.md).
