# Welcome to the IPFS docs

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a set of composable, peer-to-peer protocols for addressing, routing, and transferring [content-addressed](concepts/glossary.md#content-addressing) data in a decentralized file system. Popular Web3 projects like [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io), and many others, are built on top of IPFS.

While IPFS is a file system, it is _not_ a storage system. Instead, IPFS can be thought of as both the protocol implementations of IPFS (such as [Kubo](concepts/glossary.md#kubo)) and as the decentralized network comprised of the individual [nodes](concepts/glossary.md#node) that are running protocol implementations.
