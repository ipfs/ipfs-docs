# Welcome to the IPFS docs

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized file system for building the next generation of the internet. [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io) and many popular Web3 projects are built on IPFS. Some call it the hard drive for blockchain and Web3, though its power extends much further.

## Get started

Check out these docs to get started with IPFS:

- [What is IPFS?](concepts/what-is-ipfs.md#what-is-ipfs)
- [Key concepts](concepts/README.md)
- [Case studies](concepts/README.md#examples-and-case-studies)
- [How-to guides](how-to/README.md)
- [API and CLI references](reference/README.md)
- [Install IPFS](install/README.md)

<abbr title="too long; didn't read">TL;DR</abbr>? [Glossary](concepts/glossary.md) provides short definitions of IPFS terms and concepts.
