# Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

If IRC is your go-to for discussions and help on dev topics, there are several IRC channels on Freenode dedicated to IPFS, and it’s a great place for live chat:

- Use [#ipfs on irc.freenode.org](irc://irc.freenode.org/%23ipfs) for general IPFS usage and community chat
- Use [#ipfs-dev on irc.freenode.org](irc://irc.freenode.org/%23ipfs-dev) for discussing implementation details, especially if you are contributing code to IPFS

## IRC and the forums

For longer-lived discussions and for support, please use the discussion forums at [https://discuss.ipfs.io](https://discuss.ipfs.io) instead of IRC! It’s easy for complex discussions to get lost in a sea of new messages on IRC, and posting longer discussions and support requests on the forums help future visitors, too.

## Getting started with IRC

If you’re new to IRC, there are _lots_ of mobile and desktop clients for working with it. Here are a few to get you started:

- [IRCCloud](https://irccloud.com) on the web and desktop
- [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/) or [Adium](https://adium.im) on macOS
- [mIRC](http://standaloneinstaller.com/download-mirc) or [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io) on Windows
- [XChat](http://xchat.org) or [Irssi](https://irssi.org) on Linux
