# Community

IPFS is home to a vibrant, diverse community of thousands of contributors and participants from all over the globe! Here's how to get help, support, or just hang out with other folks who are helping to build the distributed web.

## Get technical support and help

Are you developing with IPFS implementations and tools, and looking for technical support from IPFS experts? For the fastest possible assistance and resolution of your support needs, do the following:

1. [Check to see if the problem / issue you've encountered has already been discussed](#_1-check-to-see-if-the-issue-you-ve-encountered-has-already-been-discussed).
2. If the your problem / issue has not been discussed or solved in the forum, [follow the general guidelines for getting useful answers to your questions](#_2-follow-the-guidelines-for-getting-useful-answers-to-your-questions). 
3. [Create a forum post in the Help section](#_3-create-a-forum-post-in-the-help-section).

### 2. Follow the guidelines for getting useful answers to your questions

Please following these general guidelines when asking for help:

- Before creating a forum post, summarize the issue / problem you are encountering. Example phrasings:
  - _Here's what I'm trying to do..._
  - _I did X and expected Y to happen..._
  - _Could this be because...?_
  - _This seems impossible because..._
  - _I've tried A, B and C to fix X, but..._
- When asking for help with one of the IPFS libraries, include the name of the exact package and version of the package/library.
- When sharing bits of code, [use markdown](community/contribute/grammar-formatting-and-style.md#style) to format code blocks so that they are easier to read.
- Ensure that you've read the forum [FAQ](https://discuss.ipfs.tech/faq) and [Terms of Service](https://discuss.ipfs.tech/tos).
- Screenshots of errors are often helpful.

### 3. Create a forum post in the Help section

Keeping in mind [the general guidlines above](#_2-follow-the-guidelines-for-getting-useful-answers-to-your-questions), do the following:

1. In [the Help category of the forum](https://discuss.ipfs.tech/c/help/13), hover over the large blue circle with a `+` symbol in the center. The text **New Topic** displays.
1. Click **New Topic**.  The **Create a new Topic** modal opens.
1. In the title field, describe what the discussion is one brief sentence.
1. Add any optional tags that help describe what subcategory the issue is in. Samples options include `go-ipfs` and `js-ipfs`.
1. Following the guidelines above, describe your issue / problem in the main text field. You can use Markdown, BBCode or HTML for formatting, and include images.
1. Click **Create Topic**. Your topic is has been created in the forum!

The forum moderators will attempt to address your post as quickly as possible.
