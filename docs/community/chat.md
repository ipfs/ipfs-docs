# Chat

## Discord

Join the [IPFS Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/KKucsCpZmY) for synchronous chat!

## Matrix

Join the [Matrix group](https://matrix.to/#/#ipfs:matrix.org)

## Forums

For longer-lived discussions and for support, please use the discussion forums at [https://discuss.ipfs.io](https://discuss.ipfs.io) instead! It’s easy for complex discussions to get lost in a sea of new messages on chat, and posting longer discussions and support requests on the forums help future visitors, too.
