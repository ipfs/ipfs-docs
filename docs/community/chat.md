# Chat

In general, public IPFS Discord channels are bridged to Matrix and Slack.  As a result, you can usually use your preferred chat application to engage with the community.  IPFS channels/rooms are usually prefixed with "#ipfs-".

## Discord

Join the [IPFS Discord server](https://discord.gg/ipfs) for synchronous chat! [Server documentation can be found on Notion](https://pl-strflt.notion.site/IPFS-Discord-Server-Documentation-85bbc451303a473bbf6846b01610e3c1).

## Matrix

Join the [Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#ipfs-space:ipfs.io). [Homeserver documentation is available on Notion](https://pl-strflt.notion.site/IPFS-Matrix-Homeserver-Documentation-31481e76843547b7ab5160a87eed2b9f).

## Slack

Join [Filecoin slack](https://filecoin.io/slack) and join the bridged #ipfs channels. The [Filecoin Slack workspace user guide is available on Notion](https://pl-strflt.notion.site/Filecoin-Slack-User-Guide-29072679986b4ccb8ad7b091097dd770).

## Forums

For longer-lived discussions and for support, please use the discussion forums at [https://discuss.ipfs.tech](https://discuss.ipfs.tech) instead! It’s easy for complex discussions to get lost in a sea of new messages on chat, and posting longer discussions and support requests on the forums help future visitors, too.
