# Chat

## Matrix

If synchronous chat is your go-to for discussions and help on dev topics, there are several Matrix channels on `ipfs.io` dedicated to IPFS and related topic, it’s a great place for live chat:

- Use [`#lobby:ipfs.io`](https://matrix.to/#/#lobby:ipfs.io) for general IPFS usage and community chat.
- Topical rooms:
  - [`#ipld:ipfs.io`](https://matrix.to/#/#ipld:ipfs.io)
  - [`#libp2p:ipfs.io`](https://matrix.to/#/#libp2p:ipfs.io)
  - Want to chat Filecoin? [Join the community here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community#join-the-community).

## Discord

The IPFS Matrix and Discord communities are mostly bridged. If you'd prefer to use Discord instead of Matrix, simply join [here](https://discord.gg/Z4H6tdECb9)!

## Matrix and the forums

For longer-lived discussions and for support, please use the discussion forums at [https://discuss.ipfs.io](https://discuss.ipfs.io) instead! It’s easy for complex discussions to get lost in a sea of new messages on chat, and posting longer discussions and support requests on the forums help future visitors, too.
