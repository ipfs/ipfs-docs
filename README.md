Welcome to the official IPFS documentation. The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed, peer-to-peer network for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data. Protocol Labs is the primary maintainer of the IPFS documentation and will review all issues and pull requests created in this repository.

**If you'd just like to read the IPFS documentation, we recommend the [website version](https://docs.ipfs.tech).**

## Project set up

### Run locally

To build the site locally, follow the steps below.

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs.git
   ```

2. Move into the `ipfs-docs` folder and install the NPM dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ipfs-docs
   npm install
   ```

3. Boot up the application in _dev mode_:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
5. Close the local server with `CTRL` + `c`.

## Contribute to documentation

We would **love ❤️ your help** to improve existing items or make new ones even better! [We also have bounties available](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/projects/1)!

### Suggestions

Everyone has an opinion when it comes to documentation, and **that's a good thing**! Having folks from different backgrounds add to a discussion empowers everyone within that discussion, so if you've got something to add or would like to bring up a topic for discussion about the documentation, please do so! Create an issue using the [`kind/question` tag](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Akind%2Fquestion).

### Pull requests welcome

Feel free to submit pull requests with any changes you'd like to see. If you're simply changing a typo or editing a styling bug, you can add `ciskip` to the title of your pull request to stop Filecorgi from running. Once merged, the website is updated automatically within 5-10 minutes.

## Style and configuration guide

A writing style and template guide is in the process of being written that contributors can use as a guideline.

### Static-site generator

The IPFS documentation site uses the [VuePress static website generator](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) to convert the Markdown guides into a documentation website. All the documentation is written in Markdown; follow the [VuePress Markdown documentation](https://vuepress.github.io/guide/markdown.html) for information on how to write markdown files for VuePress.

### Automated deployments

When opening a pull request, CI scripts will run against your feature branch to test your changes.

The CI/CD production workflow builds on the `main` branch and deploys the documentation site on [fleek](https://fleek.co/). The site reflects the latest commit on `main`.

### Translation

Please stay tuned on the steps to translate the documentation.
