### Bounties

You can earn the undying love of the IPFS community _and_ make some money by closing an issue with the [`bounty` tag](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abounty)!

If you are attempting to close an issue, great! Thanks for the help! Please leave a comment within the issue requesting to be assigned to that issue **before** submitting a pull request. This minimizes the chance of multiple different contributors duplicating work by submitting pull requests for the same issue. If you submit a pull request to an issue _without_ first being assigned to it, that pull request may not be accepted.

So if you've got something to add or would like to bring up a topic for discussion about the IPFS Docs project, please do so!
