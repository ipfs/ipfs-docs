# IPFS Docs Beta

This repo is home to the beta version of the IPFS next-gen documentation platform, built on top of [VuePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress).

## Want to contribute to IPFS docs?

**We'd love your contributions! Right now, all open documentation issues and help-wanted items (including bounty items!) can be found in the [main IPFS Documentation repo](https://github.com/ipfs/docs).** As the beta site being iterated upon in this `ipfs-docs-v2` repo comes out of beta, we'll migrate it into the main IPFS docs repo.

## Join our monthly sync

Every month the team gets together to discuss plans for the coming four-ish weeks. This meeting usually happens on the last Tuesday of each month. Here are the details for the next meeting:
