If you are attempting to close an issue that has a bounty assigned to it, great! Thanks for the help! Please leave a comment within the issue requesting to be assigned to that issue **before** submitting a pull request. This minimizes the chance of multiple different contributors duplicating work by submitting pull requests for the same issue. If you submit a pull request to an issue _without_ first being assigned to it, that pull request may not be accepted.
