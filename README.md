## Get involved

We would **love ❤️ your help** to improve existing items or make new ones even better! [We also have bounties available!](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/projects/1) Here are some ideas to get you started:

1. Join us on our monthly call!
2. Claim an [issue labeled `help wanted`](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/labels/help%20wanted)! Leave your thoughts and questions in issue comments, and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
3. Create or improve an example, tutorial, or guide! At present, we have a variety of how-tos and guides available at [docs.ipfs.io](https://docs.ipfs.io). However, every new item we can offer makes it easier for the world's community to use and build on IPFS. If you'd like to write a new tutorial or guide, [take a look in our open issues](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Category%3A+Content%22) and see if any already-identified needs appeal to you. [Some issues have bounties](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/labels/bounty)! If you'd like to write something entirely new, feel free — PRs are welcome! Or, if you'd just like to improve existing docs content, feel free to fork it and add your suggestions.
4. Help us improve how we present reference and API documentation. In Q2 2020, we're investigating the best way to improve how we present reference materials like API documentation and command-line dictionaries. Got thoughts? [Please discuss them!](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/issues/393)

If you're able to contribute to any of the categories above, we thank you in advance! Your work directly improves the future of IPFS for the global community! Before posting a PR with your changes, please be sure to check [our documentation style guide](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/DOCS_STYLEGUIDE.md) and the overall [IPFS contributor guidelines](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) so we can ensure that docs are clear, consistent, and simple to read.

### Objectives for 2020 Q2

Here's a summary of this our objectives for the first three months of 2020:

1. Deprecate the legacy site. ipfs/docs#475
2. A web developer's introduction: create a series of tutorials aimed at giving web developers a hands-on introduction to IPFS and get them building cool stuff quickly. [Issue #464](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/issues/464)
3. Replace the outdated material at dweb-primer.ipfs.io with the material updated and granted to ipfs-shipyard in January 2020, and point to it in docs as such.
4. Automate the docs: install/create automation tools to _automagically_ test the docs for spelling mistakes, grammar mistakes, and broken links. [Issue #463](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/issues/463)
5. Single-source documentation: bring in all the documentation that currently lives in several different repos into the ipfs/docs repo. [Issue #462](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/issues/462)
