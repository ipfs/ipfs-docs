# Deploy workflow - triggered by workflow_run after successful build
# This workflow has access to secrets but never executes untrusted code
# It only downloads and deploys pre-built artifacts from the build workflow
# Security: Fork code cannot access secrets as it only runs in build workflow
# Deploys to IPFS for all branches and GitHub Pages for main branch only
